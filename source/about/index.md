# Bio
A husband and father of two daughters, I hold a [Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering](http://www.ece.utexas.edu?utm_source=ericdmoore.com&utm_medium=web) from [The University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utexas.edu?utm_source=ericdmoore.com&utm_medium=web) and a Master of Business Administration from [Southern Methodist University](http://www.smu.edu?utm_source=ericdmoore.com&utm_medium=web) where I graduated in the Dean's Circle of the Business Leadership Center. My career so far has been a string of innovative software companies in Texas. 

I have been a developer, a product manager, a marketer, and for a short time... a data scientist. This work experience gives me a unique and holistic perspective on software organizations.

As a Product Manager at [rewardStyle](https://www.rewardstyle.com?utm_source=ericdmoore.com&utm_medium=web), I helped design and market new products that grew revenue streams by enabling the dual customer base, fashion bloggers and retailers, to better match readers for marketing campaigns between influencers and retailers. While working at [Koupon Media](http://kouponmedia.com?utm_source=ericdmoore.com&utm_medium=web), the leader in the mobile coupon industry, I designed the user experience of the initial consumer app and the coupon management platform helping brands and target offers to customers and stores. I helped devise the first system to trigger an offer based on geofences and Bluetooth beacons. I also helped start the, then fledgling, Analytics team within Koupon Media, chartered with making sense of the data collected from the platform and publishing insights to retailers. 

I serve on the board of directors for the First Baptist Church of Dallas, mentor young entrepreneurs, and am an keenly interested in a few local charities - [Strong Marriages](http://www.strongmarriages.com?utm_source=ericdmoore.com&utm_medium=web) and [Chase's Place](http://www.chasesplace.org?utm_source=ericdmoore.com&utm_medium=web) - a special needs school in the Dallas metro area.

Most of all, I am an entrepreneur committed to the belief that we are called to recklessly chase our dreams. I have paricipated with companies big and small - some build a product by cracking a whip over their internal teams, other companies inspired the troops via the goodness of their cause. It is a watershed difference. 

The primary purpose of any company is *to create value* but that is always a dual-sided proposition: **build your team** to **delight your customers**. Neglect your team at the expense of your cause. Acknowledge the dreams of your team and customers and chase them. These things, together, have enormous effects; "the office" is no longer the storehosue of "work", but instead it is the environment where creative solutions solve problems, a place where you chase dreams.

Sounds "cheesy"? Ever tried it?

# The Cover Image

The cover image is a favorite work of art: [The Great Wave off Kanagawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa) because it represents innovation in  business. Innovation comes in waves, and wildly successful companies pick tall waves. Organizations work to catch waves, and the lucky ones work to escape their wave. Whether surfing or skiing, "riding down the face" is the thrill of the day. Acceleration is exhilarating (it also happens to create value too).

If ericdmore.com accepted guest posts:
- Comments would be ON & routed to the author
- Thanked in a subsequent post from ME

http://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2012/10/06/how-to-submit-a-guest-post/#353652df6aae

Send me a query. 
Send me a proposal - not the full article. Keep it brief: a tentative headline; two or three sentences explaining what the article will be about; and one sentence saying why you are qualified to write it. Based on this proposal I will let you know within three business days whether to submit the article. If you do not hear from me in that time, please assume that I will not be able to publish your submission; you should then feel free to offer it elsewhere. My e-mail is: djacobs@forbes.com

Write with the reader in mind. Writing for the web is different from writing for print. The best way to organize the piece is to start with a brief set-up that hooks the reader. Then organize the rest in segments (as I’ve done with this article).  Assume the reader is busy and has a short attention span. Short paragraphs and headings within the article make it easier to read.

A couple of other tips: avoid throat-clearers or advice that readers will find obvious; use strong examples to support what you say.

Include a brief bio at the top. This means your name; the name of your company (with a link to your website); and if you’ve written a book relevant to the article, the title of that book with a link to the Amazon page or to your website if the book is available for sale there. If you tweet, please indicate that, and include a link to your Twitter profile page. Do not include puffery - for example, that you are the best career counselor in the world; have been voted a superlawyer; or are a popular keynote speaker.

Submit the completed article. Please don’t send me a rough draft and ask me to critique it or tell you whether you are on the right track. Paste the article into the body of an e-mail, or attach it as a Microsoft word document.

What happens next. I will acknowledge receipt of your article the same day, and let you know within a week whether it has been accepted for publication. If it is, I reserve the right to edit the article at my discretion, including changes in the text, subheads, and headline, to improve readability and maximize web traffic.
