Now that I have your attention:

Let's get some things straight:

1. America is the greatest country that has ever been founded. She is unique in inception, unique in purpose, and foudned on philosophy, a certain American pragmatic philosophy.
2. We have a government that is intended to be of the people, by the pepole, and for the people.
3. It was conceived by now highly revered poeple.
4. We had a government created with a healthy skepticism of too energetic a government - which is the origin governemtal of checks and balances.
5. America is founded on the notion that we, the individuals on this country, together with individuals all over the planet, have inalieable rights the we posess before any government was ever established.
6. America is founded on the notion that liberty and happiness could be avaialbe to all people, but since we all differ in our aspiration and capabilities it not pheasible to any organization - to create happiness for everyone.
7. Thus, American liberty has the unified purpose to permit individuals to pursuit their own happiness.
8. American Government was originally intended to be small so that American individual liberties could be big.
9. Teddy Roosevelt started, then compounded by Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Rooselvelt, and perhaps cosumated by Lyndon Johnson, the executive branch's giant land grab of powers beyond what its consitutional framing; and the legislature tacitly, and complicity did very little other than watch it happen.
10. Ever since the expansion of executive branch, our little triangle of government has been increasingly squished, and it risks collapsing into a bent line, with an asterisk that clarifies the invisble or uneffectual but extant line.
