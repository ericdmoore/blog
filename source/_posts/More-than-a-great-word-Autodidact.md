```Autodidact: A Self-Taught Person```

Autodidact is not only a word for people who love words - it is a word for people who like to hire great people. It literally means self-taught. 

# Self Taught

Autodidact means self-taught. Which is not only a signal of intellectual curiosity, but the things that someone chooses to teach them self also tell a story of where that person has been, what they have found important, and then lastly you can test for their depth of knowledge in their ability to "self-teach". Khan Academy offers impressive coverage over things that any life-long-learner might want to know.

# Self-Organizing

Often times there are other signals to be gleaned in how someone is able to accomplish self-learning. Often times people creat support groups of similar minded people as a means of creating accountability.

# Self Motivated

Perhaps the strongest signal is that the autodidact person is highly motivated to start and finish things that are keeping from achieving their version of greatness.

# More Inspired - Less Managed

So perhaps one of the key questions is if you are a manager or employer how to you work with these self-starters. It is pretty much a given that today's business as asking for "self-starters" - but all too often I hear many of these businesses who fail to actually DO anything with all this raw talent. To sum up what I have witnessed is: Autodidacts are much more easily inspired into a direction than steered, managed, or any other type of top-down control.
