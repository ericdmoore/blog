TLDR:

- Global leaders now dont care what the President says - they want to see US laws - since presidents come and go all so quickly.
- The US is trying to make a bully pulput to create change for climate change and just made giant new commmitments 
- One fascinating tentative commitment is 80% zero-coal electicity sourcing by 2030
- Renewable Power historically is not `on-demand` power. It's `as-available` which is a problem for electric grids all over
- Unless you buy lots and lots of electricity storage,  batteries, and other things
- In conconclusion buy Tesla stonks

## Biden Holds Climate Summit

It's official - the rest of the world has woken up to the modern American way of governing where presidents, elected with excitement and fanfare, are met with the stark realization that law makers still hold so many of the cards. Recent presidents, of all shapes and sizes, then resort to executive orders in effort to make good on _some_ of thier campaign promises. All the while perpetuating _American Short-termism_ for which we are known the world over.

When you apply this odd system to climate change politics, it makes for an interesting game of poker played at the world stage. Russia, India, and China basically see the US as impotent in its ability to enact longer term leverage on thiese matters, so they are making zero new commitment when prompted, cajoled, or given a request to do so.

## Biden Tries To Lead By Example

And now, in a show of American bravado, we the good ol US of A is going to half our 2005 carbon output by 2030 (that's nine plus years from the time of this writing). Additionally, with some political manuevering, the Biden administration intends to pass sweeping legislation, via the Budget Reconciliation methods due to lacking the votes to pass a regular bill, and all done to placate the world stage that has grown weary of political party vascilations. 

The Infrastrtucture bill, will include plenty of infrastructure, sure, but new revisions also include a clause that states
<!-- more --> 
"80% of American electricty will come from zero carbon sources by 2030".

As a Texan who just dealt with the snow storm of the century, let me first start by saying renewable energy is great. Texas has plenty renewable options to chose from. But the storm we had was compounded by peak-power-generation leaving the supply discusion when the going got tough.

Sure there is some odd, but very Texan preocupation with having our own grid (let's address that at another time), but most importantly Texas renewables have recently become the legitimate cheapest option for countless homes across the state, including mine in Dallas. And while electricty is confusing for many people, its a very big business, but for most independent power producers (IPP) in Teaxas its a low margin grid of a busoiness.

If you bought a bright old fashion 100W light bulb, and left it on for 10hrs - you just used `1000 Wh` or pronounced "watt hours" which is how you arenpm  billed - Wh. Its no differnt than running ten 100W bulbs for 1 hour, that's sill `1000 Wh` aka the same cost to your electric bill. So at any given moment, a power plant might be making a few Million Watts, or ant any moment your home might be comsuming sevral hundred wats, but when you pull power from that plant all day, your bill is be measured in `Wh`.

And with that basic electricity 101 out of the way, it's amzing to know that homes usually have a fixed price plan for elecrity but the whole sale rate for electricty can have wild swings. It can even go negative in places where they have too much and they want someone to take the power off their hands. 

The Texas power market allows IPPs to bid a supply of electricity and a price for that, and then [ERCOT](//www.ercot.com), yes plenty of people have PTSD at the mention of that name, will award the cheapest bid the option to produce that power, for the corresponding hour the next day. So from an econ perspective, each day has an hourly  supply-side price curve, and in the ice-storm, supply dipped below demand. And since this is not like selling a PS5 or an iPhone, where you have supply shortages, and that makes anxious buyers wait in line at the chance to get their prized purchase, ERCOT actually had to tell various Power Cos to turn help them "shape demand" (aka - turn off the power to our home)

All this to say, my family is buying the cheapest power we can get which is a solar-power company yay for solar, but consider the fact that solar does not make that much power in a snow storm due to cloud cover, etc. So the solar company, can undercut so many fossil-fuel players since their marginal costs are effectively zero, but when bad weather occurs, they just put in a very low bid, which is good for their business, but bad for the energy ecosystem. The Peakers have the upper hand in predictable conditions, but when  it all goes to pot, they will leave you with your lights, off in the cold, and any emergency equipment you might need bricked.

I hope the Biden administration will also incentivize states to pass laws that encourage `peakers` (aka: `as-available` power producers) to become `base-load` (aka: `on-demand` producers) - as they say in the energy business. Which means solar companies will be incentivized to have some level of energy storage, like a [large battery bank installation](https://www.tesla.com/utilities), a [10 ton weight in a mine shaft](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/gravity-based-batteries-try-beat-their-chemical-cousins-winches-weights-and-mine-shafts), or even [compressed air in a salt-mine](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/goderich-ontario-compressed-air-energy-storage-1.5369478). Frankly, the Biden administration might incentivze municipalities to become energy sotrage facilities, and they could pay for the cost of the installation by using their "batteries" to buy up cheap energy and then to sell back some percent when the prices go up.

This would be tranformative for the American power grid (check: Biden Goal ) - AND more importantly it will prevent the propagation of the Texas ice storm calamity of 2021 to the rest of the country. Energy storage is arguably more needed than energy production since the market is already moving that way.
