I have no pretenses that I will complete this list before the year end. But its worth a try. I just finished Wabi-Sabi, Fear,and Scarcity listed below. All interesting books in their own right. I have started Essays Against Everything - and Clouds of Glory. I hope to share the essayists affectation for language, and to discover a bit more of postive parts of the troubled history of Robert E Lee - all the while senstive to the fact that white historians are usually going to be mute on the greater issues of racial reconciliation.

So, here it is, the list, partially started, partially finished, mostly lays waiting for me to go faster.
