The AppStoreÂ® is the largest working model of what it means to sell software online in a modern era. The Google Play store is a modern contemporary that obviously deserves mention, as it has

# TL;DR

- Each manual update which triggers review by Apple causes delay and drama
- AppStore does not support paid upgrades, only new App, in-App purchase or subscriptions
- Apple takes 30% and that is not sustainable to run a company and pay salleries
- it is not provide to provide free updates forever
- if you purchased our application this year we provide a direct license, if you had it significantly longer, we think a paid upgrade is fair for continuously developing, improvements, and support

We also do not enjoy charging for updates, but it is simply not possible to develop and support a product indefinetly for free.

# Not friendly to users nor developers

For many years developers were not particularly satisfied with Apple's AppStore. It creates an artificial frontier between users and developers. Developer can not inform users about updates, tips, issues or fixes, and users often turn to the AppStore with one star reviews and negative comments instead of reaching out to developers to find a solution. Additionally Apple manually reviews all applications and updates. This often causes delay and frustration when developers need to get urgent bug fixes to users, and users can not downgrade to a previous version unless they keep an backup themselves. Last but not least Apple even charges 30% from the developers sales, income that naturally companies would rather spend on hiring new developers, support staff, marketing and administration.

There are also additional, smaller points, such as only allowing one price tier for the whole world, without a mean to discount an application for example in developing countries, or that it often takes some time until updates are approved. Unfortunately updates are also often rejected for random reasons, sometimes a screenshot, duplicate applications icon (yes, seriously when ExactScan and Pro shared the same 7 years and 100 updates later!), when the reviewer can not scan, or they want us to adopt new development guidelines. These design guidelines often only cause unnecessary changes, and thus work and potentially new bugs, without any visible benefit to the user.

 HISTORY:

SKETCH LEAVES THE MAC APP STORE Sketch, winner of an Apple Design Award back in 2012, is leaving the Mac App Store:

There are a number of reasons for Sketch leaving the Mac App Store--many of which in isolation wouldn't cause us huge concern. However as with all gripes, when compounded they make it hard to justify staying: App Review continues to take at least a week, there are technical limitations imposed by the Mac App Store guidelines (sandboxing and so on) that limit some of the features we want to bring to Sketch, and upgrade pricing remains unavailable.

Summary of AppStore drawbacks There is mostly only one benefit for users: one central place for purchasee and updates. However, there are many negatives, such as:

# For Users

- no free trial
- no going back to previous versions, unless local backup
- days or weeks delay, for each small bug fix
- no upgrade discount, unless weekend sales or subscription
- Apple's 30% cut might increase some prices
- single point of failure and censorship

# For Developers

- additional application variant to build and test
- need to send each update to Apple
- huge delay for at times highly important fixes, e.g. for new devices
- often review rejected for text, images, random issues
- 30% of the sales go to Apple, huge loss in income (unless price is increased)
- one price for whole world, even if XCHG rate makes prices sub-optimal
- no discount for developing countries
- disconnect from the users, which often simply post bad app reviews, or return the app instead of reaching out to - developer for actually support and fixes
- need to write app, text and artwork to pass Apple's review
- random censorship of whatever Apple does not like
- payout avg. 6 weeks after sales, long time to pay running costs
- (need to pay $99 a year for the privilege)
