Question:
It is well established that the NFL breaks down the brains of its players very quickly (called C.T.E.s) - and churns through willing participants to trade their body for our entertainment (and sometimes handsome sums of money) - does this make us complicit in an insatiable appetite of blood lust?

In a hypothetical universe, If we picked beautiful people with incredible lungs sizes - and asked them to to smoke as many cigarettes as humanly possible in 10 minutes - and the winners get a million bucks… (and if that was incredibly entertaining to watch) - would you tune in - and feel comfortable watching such barbarism? (its not too dis-similar to watching alcohol drinking competitions albeit typically not televised)

Or in a different parallel universe, maybe states could raise new revenue (and keep taxes low) by selling tickets to jury sentenced executions? 


Why is executions as entertainment so revolting (that is a modern phenomenon - as there is a long history of hangings in the town square for the masses to watch), the "cigarettes show" falls somewhere in the middle (you likely think the idea is interesting - and you will forget about it by tomorrow) - but football…. football is somehow sacrosanct??
