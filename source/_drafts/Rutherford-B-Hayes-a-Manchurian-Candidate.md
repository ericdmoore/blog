I just finished a book called Attention Merchants, a detailed history of the advertising business. It starts with Clark Stanley (og status of snake oil salesman) and systematically covers, the birth of advertising in News Papers, its migration to radio, to re-birth into TV, and then its getting dragged onto the internet. Each stop on the journey introduces the reader to the iconoclast of the era, like Mad Men's inspiration David Ogilvy (og Don Drapper), or MTV's business model problem that was saved by their creation of what would later be called reality TV (og Real World)

The book does an incredible job of setting the historical frame of advertising. It is an entertaining read for any student of business models. However it seems like it might just be the worlds largest preamble for Tim Wu's second book, The Master Switch.

<!-- more --> 

The name of Wu's second book is a reference to quote on free speech by Fred Friendly, 

> "...freedom of speech depends on who controls the master switch" - Fred Frienly

Wu's makes the point that our freedom is a lame duck if we fail to make something from it. And our ability to think has a direct relationship to the thoughts that we swim in. And increasingly we are swimming not in a collective open ocean but in an articiially sweetend and acidic media pool that we choose to go skinny dipping in.



It is against this back drop that the story of Rutherford B Hayes is told. I have a particular soft spot for RBH - as he and I share a birhday date. In school I always wished he were a great preseident so that I would have some fun but meaningless thread connecting me to greatness. But even my hope of meaningless greatness ended in failure, as my high school teacher let me down slowly - that RBH's historical significance, a phrase frequently peddled in that class, was that he somehow became president, peacable ceeded control to the the next president, then died. 

Needless to say I was crushed.

But Tim Wu, offers a much more intriguing lens by which to view the administration of the 19th president. A lens steeped in the technological innovation of the times - the telephone.

Against the backdrop of Western Union, a benevolent monopoly of the telegraph times, Alexander Bells invention sets the stage of a silly invention against the the giant incumbent. The giant incumbent was perhaps more powerful than we have comparison in today's terms. 

Western Union arguably made Rutherford B Hayes president much like Jeff Smith in "Mr Smith Goes to Washington" becomes Senator thanks to the back room dealings between the govenor, the news paper owners, and the sitting senator.
