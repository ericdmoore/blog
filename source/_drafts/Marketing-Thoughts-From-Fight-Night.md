1. Life is a marathon not a sprint - no matter your spirits in Round 1-5. Know that you have to carry it all 12 rounds if needed. Don't hold back but make sure to not run out of gas.



2. Boxing is often called barbaric, by non-boxing people. But with enough self-promotion and fanfare. The winner would take home 100M and $30M would even go to the loser. Haters gon hate. But move on and don't spend too much time on your would be detractors. Put your self out there. Be you, and you will attract your own kind.



3. Tickets speak louder than words. Ever hear a friend say for 30M bucks I would take a punch to the face from Floyd Money Mayweather? The problem with this logic, is that when Frank says that at the office coffee spot, he has the order of operations backwards. McGregor takes home 30M not because he was willing to lose but because he had a chance at winning. I would not pay 100 bucks for Pay-Per-View to watch Mayweather pumel some Joe off the street with a one-hitter-quitter.



4. Winning Forgives Many Faults. Twitter was abuzz with Mayweathers pregame antics. iPod classic + a scalp massage seemingly lounging in a smoking jacket. But when you pull through and win, you quickly hear people who poke fun at the beginning think, well maybe we should all try scalp massages.
