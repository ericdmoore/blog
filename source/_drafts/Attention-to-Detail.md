## Challenge #1 : Standing Out

Standing out in a bad way is clearly easier than making a positive mark on the world, but even making a ruckus that people actually care about - postive or negative is just hard.

## Seldom The Answer: Better Technology

It almost does not matter 
In a world where everyone can speak, the listener is washed over with a constant flood of noisy information.

## Often The Answer: Care More

Not only do you care more, you are also willing to listen for your friends, and even bring them something they might like. Leadership is often touted as the willingness to walk alone, and while that part of it - it is certainly not all. Attention to Details often just boils down to attention. How much attention to you give your customers, your market, your team, your product. Our "activated attention" is likley the most valuable thing we can give. Activated Attention is not the check the box attetion you often give your spouse. Activated Attention is when you are empathizing, thinking what would they like, would they love, what would they love even more than that? What makes them tick? That takes real attention - attention intending to please. 

Why do some people by Philips Hue Light bulbs? 
Why do some people by selvedge denim? 
Why would anyone buy Folgers over Maxwell House? [^1]
Why buy Community Coffee over Folgers?
Why buy Starbucks over Community Coffee?
Why buy Blue Bottle over Starbucks?
Why do people buy hand stichted leather bags?
Why do some people buy Beringer over Yellowtail wine?
Why do some people buy Mondavi over Beringer wines?
Why do some people buy Far Niente over Mondavi?
Why do some people buy an 1865 Chateu Lafite over Far Niete?[^2]?

Once you decide you care about something, it becomes closer to your identity. And you are a "that kind" of person. Once that happens, you want something that represents you well without breaking the bank. 

If you are a "coffee person", you likely move up from Maxwell House as fast as you can affoard it. Furthermore, over hearing discussions from so called "coffee people" debating the merrits of Folgers vs Maxwell House reminds you when you used to be young and ignorant about the world, and becomes a mile marker allowing you to look back and see how far you have come.
