Sometime ago, I endeavored into making a new software system ([Fedearlies](//federali.es)) that would bring the power of web apps to people who make content. So that can experience the modern renaisance in advancing technology of web applications.

If you make contnet - you are stuck writing your words in some likely old editor that has shaped what you believe is possible. (TinyMCE you WERE once great, and you have served your time well. But the web should move on)

And as anyone with the gumption to start something new, a lack of ambition has never been my tragic flaw. But piles of ambitions coupled with only two hands to type - is where things get interesting. I had long idealized the dream of being a solo-developer/solo-entrepreneur. Grow slow and steady. And retain the vision and control. 

<!-- more -->

 I have decided that the vision is still incredibly important, but even more important is a chance to turn the knobs and levers of such a product. So that as the Japanese say, I can experience it for myself. Hopefully this will be a process that leads to faster market validation.

Everyday, I am inspired by somethings going on within the internet culture. The continued success of:

- [Fastmail](//fastmail.com/) & [Protonmail](//protonmail.com/)
- [Mastadon](//joinmastodon.org/)
- [Lobste.rs](//lobste.rs)

The overwhelming success of component architecutres:

- [React](//reactjs.org/)
- [Vue](//vuejs.org/)
- [Preact](//preactjs.com/)
- [Hyperapp](//hyperapp.js.org/) &

Other Tools that help make the process of stitching all of this together a bit easier to maintain. Thnigs like:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Zeit](https://zeit.co/)
- [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Shopify](//shopify.com)
- [Squarespace](//squarespace.com)
- [Gumroad](//gumroad.com)

And even still there are other groups who aim to make the independent web financially sustainable. Groups like

- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) _used by content creators and plenty others_
- [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) _for software projects_
- [Shopstyle](https://www.shopstyle.com/) _for fashion bloggers_

And yet there are even other projects like these - that create the groundwork of decoupling the data or content layers from the presentations layers. Which really does create the educational awareness of why these practices and principles are beneficial. Projects like:

- [Contentful](//contentful.com)
- [Tipe](//tipe.io/)
- [Forestry](//forestry.io/)

But with that there are aslo woes of privacy, data breaches, facebook scandals,
