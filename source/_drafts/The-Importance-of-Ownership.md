The American Dream

Ownership at Work

BUT somehow this is all lost when we make content.
We don't require to own our content.

There are great authors out there giving their content away to Yahoo via Tumblr.  The savvy will use Wordpress to ensure that they have their own corner of the web.

PLEASE care for your content. After all you made it. It was your's. Now its not - because you gave it away for someone else's ad dollars.
