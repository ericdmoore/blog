# TLDR;

There is a fine line to be fought for in this book. Take a deep breathe before you read this book and remember what its like to have an honest, innocent, and maybe even mutually-naive relationship with a valued peer in your life.

This book shows a great list ways that people behave; at the same time, studying the nature of man, especially as presented, can ruin every relationship you possess. It naturally wants to turn  them all into self-centered manipulations.
