Took Foudnations, Focus, & Build

Foundations is great
Focus is amazing
Build was an odd ball - as it was helpful but no company I have worked at did or could quickly change to their prescribed ideal state.

Problem Defines the Solution

RULE 1 If product managers don’t do their jobs, the other departments will fill the void.
RULE 2 An outside-in approach increases the likelihood of product success.
RULE 3 Time spent on the strategic reduces time wasted on the tactical.
RULE 4 In the absence of market facts, he who owns the compiler wins. 
RULE 5 Product Management determines the go-to-market strategy; Marcom executes the strategy. 
RULE 6 Product Management should help sales channels, not individual salespeople. 
RULE 7 Be able to articulate your distinctive competence.
RULE 8 Your opinion, although interesting, is irrelevant.
RULE 9 The building is full of product experts. Your company needs market experts.
RULE 10 Find market segments that value your distinctive competence.
RULE 11 Don’t expect your sales channel to conduct win/loss analysis.
RULE 12 The answer to most of your questions is not inside your office building.
RULE 13 Every “product” needs a product manager and a business case.
RULE 14 Look for opportunities to deliver the remarkable.
RULE 15 With positioning, the focus is on what we do for the buyers.
RULE 16 Positioning should be complete before you start developing.
RULE 17 You need a positioning document for each type of buyer.
RULE 18 Name the product after positioning is finished.
RULE 19 Provide collateral, tools, and programs to support each step in the sales cycle.
RULE 20 The market-driven product manager should be the final authority on what goes into the product.
