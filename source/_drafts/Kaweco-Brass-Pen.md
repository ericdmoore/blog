I am the proud owner of an incredibly heavy, over-engineered, brass pen with a ton of gnurling. I love my Embassy Pen. It feels substantial, writes well with a Fisher SpacePen ink, and has a snug fit.

However, carrying this at the bottom of my back-left jeans pocket, has caused some rather comical wear spots in many of my pants. Not to mention while traveling through San Diego, an over zealous TSA agent was adamant that I was carrying a weapon. You know who you are... Sharron...

All that to say, I my recent purchase of a Kaweco Brass Sport ballpoint pen was an attempt get something with a similar, but smaller, lighter, and presumably equal quality to my favored Embassy Pen - which is  made in the Good Ol USA.

After the Altoid tin "unboxing," I can say I prefer the smaller length/size, and the raw brass finish was as expected. It is bigger than a Bullet SpacePen - in length and diameter. But in comparison to the Embassy pen, everthing else fell a little short. The friction fit clip, for example, slides off the cap if you are clipping it at a bad angle, or on thick fabric. No problem a little pressing of the thumbs and I had bent it a little more snug.

The Kaweco ink stick, was skipping and hard hard starts. When it would write I liked that it was darker than a the SpacePen ball point. However, tough to enjoy quality that seldom comes out. Not to worry some reviews online also complained about the rattling of the ink stick in the barrel cone, which is overcome by 1 layer of clear tape. So one trip to an "ACME Desk Supply Co" later and I was the owner of 2 parker gel refill, and after wrapping them in 1 layer of clear tape. It will write pretty well.

Lastly, the cap posts. This seems trivial until you create a new grip for grasping your pen so as to accomodate holding the cap in you lesser fingers. Needless to say, I enjoy that this pen posts. However, it was oh-so-daintily sitting atop the pen barrel; and it would even fly off if handled vigorously. Given I am a little bit (enough) Italian, I talk with my hands enough to cause this prim and proper pen cap to get strewn about a room. But alas, nothing that a little clear tape can not fix.

So there you have it, a Kaweco pen ++. It is much better than what I got out of the box. It writes well, the cap stays posted (even when pointing with the pen), the clip does not so easily slide off, and it is just the right size for my pockets to not wear on the corners.

Kaweco if you are listening:

- Preserve the inkstick for ready use on unboxing
- Tighten the barrel cone on the ink stick to avoid rattling
- Tighten up the cap when posting to avoid losing the cap
- Crimp the pen clip a little harder


Other than that. I really like the pen. Really! it is finally a great little knock-around pen.
