It is 41F here in downtown Dallas, TX today, and I just peddled my first brisk  1mi journey through the heart of darkness. It was a pure death defying thrill. 

If I were to summarize it all up into 4 points they would be.

<!-- more --> 

**Bike Renting:**

0. Incredibly fun, but I almost died, really!
1. Jackets Preferred 
2. Bigger Sidewalks Requested
3. Bike Lanes Required

## Road Safety
As Ofo, Limbike, V-Bikes, et al hit cities with a new craze of stainless bike sharing. I can't help but wonder what their city agreement process is - because as a Dallas native, I grew up acknowledging that Dallas was a tough place to ride a bike. 

Not because of varied terrain, its very flat; not because of bad weather, though it can be very hot; but simply **because of Dallas drivers and sidewalks** often creating checkmate situations for cyclists and bicyclers *("Cyclist" should be reserved for those who peddling 5mi+ at a time)*

The idea of Dallas as a bike town, has always seemed laughable to me, but overnight Ofo, Limebike, V-Bike, et al decided otherwise.

## Jackets Preferred

Dallas gets HOT! I mean HOT like a simmering Tabasco Soup. As an adventure seeking male, I can psyche myself up for the thrill of riding a bike across town, but the thing that will be the "wet-blanket" on this idea for much of the year is my shirt.

Much of the US retreats indoors during  brutal winters, but here in Texas, we often retreat inside during oppresive summer days. (nights are a different story). All this equates to a terribly sweaty shirt at the mere thought of peddling across town in anything above 90F. which knocks out 4 months for me. Perhaps the Dallas ladies do not suffer the same sentiment.

On the other hand, I can speak for my wife who is less inclined to ride a bike in the "cold" at all. Hopefully she will ride more than me during the summer to make Dallas a viable bike town.

Thus peak seasons will be, no surprise, during Dallas's "San Fransisco weather" *(50s and to low 70s)* in spring and fall.




## Sidewalks: Wider is Better

The most noticeable transformation of Dallas into a "bike town" is the ~~bicycles~~ scrap metal with wheels littering the sidewalks by the DMA, Elm, Commerce, Main St, etc.

This has had its waves of good and bad. Seemingly the bike companies will come straighten them up after sufficient public backlash, or perhaps the city has decided to shoulder this burden. Some days Dallas sidewalks are landing strips for the metal carnage of dozens of ghost-ridden bikes piled high, all laying dead on their side, seemingly at the end of FOX News high-speed car chase. So if you are out for a stroll watch out for sharp edges, but more importantly the build up of bikes creates imposing obstacles for bicyclers on the sidewalk.

So as a bicycler, you have to first avoid crashing into people. This is compounded by the fact that Dallas ladies enjoy chatting and marching down sidewalks in groups 4+ wide (I am sometimes guilty of this, too). Successfully escaping the sidewalk marching rows, means you progress on to level two: Avoiding the other embankment of bikes.

Dallas should paint certain sidewalk spots as recommended areas to park the ride-share bikes. Chose sections of wide sidewalks, away from intersections, that is still close to dense and desirable destinations. No guarantee that this will help but for a minimal effort of some paint on sidewalks seems like it could be the small affordance that new bicyclers need.

## Give Me Bike Lanes, Not Death

Lastly, I can not stress it enough that Dallas has never been a bike town until December 2017. Hard to tell if Dallas is simply a bike riding hipster imposter right now, or just an adolescent who will grow-into-it. Having never been a bike-town, there is no culture of pedestrians or bicyclers (outside of White Rock Lake), so the jury is out as to how drivers respond to bicyclers in the street.
  
And therefore for Dallas to really decide that we are a bike town (which I am all for) we need to allocate some of that $1Billion City improvement bond to adding bike lanes to allow for bicylclers to get to desirable destinations with out endangering their own lives on the public lanes of critical thoroughfares.

## Conclusion

Mayors: Adding stainless bicycles to your city may be a forward thinking, zero cost to creating healthy, environmentally friendly micro-commutes around town. But make sure you have amply consider public safety ramifications before declaring an actual budget of zero for an exponential growth in bicyclers. **Sidewalks, bike lanes, policies for community managers** (aka: bicycle pile organizers), and what types of features incentives you would want from the tech company before green-lighting these great programs in your town.

*Features Requests:*
- To minimize the bike-pile-straightener job, ask the BikeShareCo to have features like incentives for good behavior
	- Get an incentive for Parking the Bike "Up Right" 
	- Get an incentive for Parking the Bike next to other bikes in a row
		- the more the better
	- Get an incentive for parking in a designated bike 
- Ask the BikeShareCo
