Engineering is Nobile.

Much like in the US you might refer to an MD or PhD as "Doctor SurName"

I was told thati in India, you would refer to them as "Engineer SurName" - while I have not verified the validity of this statement. The mere thought of that is interesting by itself.

it is of similar designation of honor.
