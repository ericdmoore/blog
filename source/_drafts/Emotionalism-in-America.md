		Modern Humans

		News Coverage. Politics. Social Media. Recommendation Engines. 
		Advertising Pays Based on Impressions.  Everyone is a Blogger.
		Opinions Abound. Facts are burried, dirty, and heavy.
		Masses flock to feeding frenzyies of cheeze-like, extruded-cornmeal snack bites.
		Where have the cowboys & whalers gone?
		Where have the scientists & preachers gone?
		Who will do the hard work, the dirty work, the heavy lifting?
		Who will save us from the worst versions of our selves?
		Who will think about not what is - but what should be?
		It is a conscious choice to be the better version of yourself.
		Who will you be today? Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde?
		Humans are a special kind of animal.
		But aren't we more than mere animal instincts?
		Humans are only animal we know of capable of abstract thought.
		So aren't we capaable of having a feeling deeper than "I Like It"?
		Capable of composing more than 140 characters?
		Choose this day who you will be. A caveman or a carpenter.
		Choose to eat a vegatable. Choose to plant a garden.
		Choose to be light, not a mirror.
		The struggle is real, sure, but fight the good fight.
		Struggle and win. Yes struggle and struggle more. 
		The struggle defines us all. But don't forget to win.
		Stuggling provides the dark and necesssary backdrop for our vicotry dright as dawn.
		Strugglers need encouragement. Repeated Encouragement.
		I will encourage you. Will You encourage me?
		See you here tomorrow. Same time, same place.

Few People are adding facts to discussions.

Cold Hard Facts

I want to think - I don't want to be sold.

The news cycle, fueled by the never-ending candy raid from the Trump Administration seems to be unwilling to tell me facts. Neihter CNN, BBC, Fox News, Drudge Report

Take for example a time when I got wrapped up in my own argument....
Poltics of 2016 presidential election.

Confession: I know a ton of people who voted for Trump & Hillary.
I also know a slew of people who voted third party feeling like both parties failed them in putting out a candidate that matchthed their beleifs.

Echo Chamberism Causes an ever-growing divergence. Such that we lose our ability to be neighborly.
