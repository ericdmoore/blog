Lawyers have made order people as neat and tidey as they can, however people are still messy. Have been, and will always be. It takes a minor miracle for a person to consistently think beyond his nose, or to think of others first. People are self-motivated, self-centered, and generally unaware of our own biases. Nonetheless lawyers love to make order and clarity in messy situations.

Sometimes the messy situations are when life presents an outcome that are incongruent with our country's self-evident truths. So lawyers diagnose how this happens, and attempt to better align our judicial system with our stated ideals. But sometimes there is only so much order you can derive from a situation; like making a

The Story of Race Relations in America, as it relates to the American justice system (not in the hearts of citizens), is a story of unintended consequences.

It in includes man's desire to have simple, clean, rules to live life; a life that usually includes increedibly complicated, layered, and mulit-facted situations.

It is as though our legal system has neatly, and perfectly ordered a bunch of people into tidy rows into the juror bench, asking them for their opinion on another industry, and forgetting we will average out a collection of bankrupt answers. We might as well ask my grandmother for investment advice too, and bet the lifes of real people on her investment ROI.

The system at large is not the problem. It is the fact that we are asking apples about the lives of oranges - and giving them too much voice over oranges. In most aspects of life, the usual situation seems like you ask the oranges to agree how we should act (aka: protocol). And then you can ask the apples, if the oranges acted as the orange said it should behave. The Apples might even comment on the "Code of Conduct for Oranges" Apples might have a chance to agree if Police followed protocol.

Idea 1
------------------
We have shackled our future to our past.

Quetelet - Discovers Averages 
British Courts - Incorporate "Average and Reasonable Man" into law

Descriptive Statistics will never tell you what we SHOULD DO - it can only provide summarization of what has already occured. We the people often then apply the principle: "Let's learn from our history;" we then doom our future to look eerily similar to the existing past.

Using data to determine our future damns us to mute our moral conscious in favor of the more objective, the more agreeable, the cleaner data.

The problem is that, in doing so, we have just swalled a trojan horse that destroys us from the inside.

Idea 2
------------------
My Legal Opinion, while perhaps interesting, Seems Irrelevant.

Trying to empathize with Police officers will leave most jurors paralyzed due to the lack of emotional stress and personality disonance with everyday cop situations. 

Much like: if a group of MBA students were attempting to judge a hedge fund manager making high dollar, naked, margin option bets on commodites. Where you are told you are one of the best in the biz, and then the data points you to push all in - to lock in returns for the retired, the widowed, orphaned, and  veterans (Your institutional LP inverstors)

But alas, the judicial system requires this of me. So in efforts of "positive participation" I comply. 

Idea 3
-------------------

My Legal Opinion Without Context Seems Dangerous.

The "reasonableness standard", if i must sit in the seat of the police officer, I can not be made to remove my opinion on the process preceeding "the moment of the decision"

I don't fret everytime a Texan reaches in his pocket. In fact the context, the environment, the way my fellow Texan reaches in his pocket matters MORE than the fact that the Texan reaches in the pocket.

If you are told to believe "someone has a gun in her pocket" you have already lost the discussion. The discussion is largely over, much like starting a chess game with no queen angainst a worthy opponent.

When I am asked is this a reasonalbe action for a police officer - I am woefully inequipped to make this judegement call. Who am I to tell the officer how to do her job. However, being an active citizen, and willing to actively particpate in the parts of due process for fellow Americans. I will tell an officer how to to do his job, but I will not be made to be silent on the process before "the momnent of decision"

When told to look at this one slice of time, and agree if it is reaonable that an officier "was afraid" in this situation, I ask - "Why show me the frame where the perp has a hand in his pocket? Why not show me the moment when the officer puts on his uniform before work?" 

Isn't every officer more acquainted with the idea that I may not go home from work? This is a context few other Americans can relate to - outside of our armed service members, I would imagine that few.

When asked if I am afraid of black people, I would argue like 99% of other Americans - a strong NO! 

However, many people
