I have long believed dreams are only dreams if they are a tiny bit unrealistic. Something worth stretching for. Any short of a stretch is just budgeting.

I believe that the best way to live life is to dream dreams big enough to scare you, but having spent some time thinking about "dreams possibly too big", I have decided it is an easy answer to the question "What does it mean to set dreams or goals that are just `other-worldy`?"

<!-- more -->

Is it okay to claim something as an impossible dream? Sure, if you are the Wright Brothers formulating an anti-gravity dark-matter plan.

You plan looks like this:

1. Find the right sub-atomic structure
2. Create a way to harvest a suitable amount of the material
3. Harness your anti-gravity particles to float forever
4. Profit?

If any of those steps breaks your whole plan breaks. However, if Orville and Wilbur instead form their plan to defy gravity - then they can spend a life time of attempting new creative options.

When the question comes, and you know it will. "Did you set your dream a little too big" 

You now know one of a few things:

- The question asker may be a doubter.
- The question asker may be nudging you to reframe your dream so that it's more open-ended. More summit oriented, and less path-dependent.
