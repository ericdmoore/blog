This Post is all over the place - what if it became multiple posts:

- `Why and How to Better Know Your Neighbors`

- `What is, and How to be A Good Digital Neighbor`

- `VR is the purest expression of Digital Neighbors`
	- `AR is the gateway drug for VR`

- `When Second-life Becomes First-Life`

- `Communication Styles with Homo-Digitalis`
	- Why can we have constructive discourse?
	- The format does not reward it
		- People are playing different games
			- Scrupples, Scabble, Sorry, and Seven-Card-Draw-Poker 
			- At the same time - on the same board.
		- `Scrupples` people keep asking existential questions
		- `Scrabble` people let them know they misspelled thier question
		- `Sorry` players keep trying to cut people down so they have to start over at the beginning of the board - or claim that they are in their safety zone.
		- `Seven-Card-Draw` are saying ridiculous things to help them clear the board into their pile of winnings.

- `Understanding Digital Friendship and Digital Acquaintances`
	- How many Of Your Social "Friends" measure up to real-friendship
	- Things can be quantified online, therefore they often get quantified
	- Because of CAN not because of SHOULD - consider the cheapening of volunteering by assigning a value to it



We as people (now "homo-digitalis") have a choice. Make "friends" online, or make "Friends" offline.

Let's determine what a friend is, since there is certainly a fuzzy border around what is a frined:

<!-- more --> 

Example:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UgGhA-M3U0M?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;start=6" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

So a friend might not know your shoe size, but there usually a few of these:
- a mutual appreciation for shared companionship
- a mutual feeling of reliability, helpfulness, appreciation for the person
- a mutual willingness to be open, honest, and trusting 

in days of old - we might have used the word comrade for such a close friend.

`Comrade` comes from the latin `camera` meaning: chamber or room - and it was baically a personificaiton of the term - aka: a room mate.

Someone who you got to know very well - largely due to proximity.

Here is another interesting thing in friend making.

Proximity First friend - a sign of similar intent, or similar interests.

`Modern Room Mates` - are the definition of this. both may have chosen to be in the same city, or college, at the same dorm and on the same floor.

`Neighbors` - are one step beyond. the both the purchaser (or related to the purchaser) a home in the same neighborhood. As such they may value the same types of characteristics in a neighborhood, old charming houses with stately trees, or crisp new sub-division with great schools, or large lots with plenty of room for kids to run and play.

`Co Worker or Cube-Mate` - 

The relationship has a chance to build, grow, and establish due to increased interation time.

The miracle of kinship is when people are not bound to this proximity based head-start.

`Similar Interest` - aka Meetup



**Hypothesis**: You CAN know some one much more intimately online. This does not mean that you typically do... But when peolpe pour their heart and soul into some type of post whereever that might live - you have the chance of learning about that person. In a way that neighbors often don't open up without some level of intentionality.

This level of intimacy, kinship, strong belonging, offers a huge inticement.  It is slowing changing our preferences; what used to be called second-life[^secondLife] is quicly becoming first life for some.

Community - Sense of Belonging

- Community Building
- Friends of a Friend (FOAF) 
	- [Me] --> Friend:Alice --> Bob
	- Alice does some connection work and decides Bob and I should meet
- FOAF<sup>2</sup>
	- [Me] --> Friend:Alice --> Bob --> Charlie
	- Alice and Charlie have met before
	- Alice or Bob decide that I should meet Charlie

So there is a process of taking a chain of friendship and folding it on itsef. Said differently: it is the social norm of opening up the cocktail conversation circle when someone new shows up just outside. Clearly, this has human boundaries.

The same principles apply both online and offline.

Even still, while we are still physical beings. Every so often

`AR` is the gate way drug to `VR`

`AR` market is much larger in terms of eyeballs. The `VR` market is much larger in terms of mindshare for its users.

Its a breadth vs depth game. `AR` will get transactional attention from multiple billions of people. `VR` will get TV-like-binge-attention from many many millions. Eitherway the game is `eyeball-hours`. So you can saturate the hours from a few. Or `advertisers` can elbow, and outbid each other to fight for the right micro-moment within your connected-camera-augmented perspective.

What does `VR` mean for community building?
