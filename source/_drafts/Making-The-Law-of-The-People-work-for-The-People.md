What if I wrote a series of articles breaking down contract laws,  with interviews from legal professionals, and keen eye to the existing `stare decisis`

Topics to Cover:

### Contract Law

### Employment Laws

### Incorporation Laws

<!-- more -->

We could start with any of those, or something else. What seems interesting to you? Find me on the internet (links below) anet me know.
