if you have building block wooden ones - not legos - the tallest tower you can build that does not easily fall over is determined by your understanding of civil engineering principles (sure), but more importantly it is determined by the cohesiveness of the blocks you are using, say you are using 1 inch wooden cubes. But infact some are 1.25inches some are .8 inches - the first thing you have to do is sort them into a layer that are all have a similar height.

In doing this you have made a precise interface. 

<!-- more --> 

Without ths first floor interface - then floor 2 starts in different places, and this will get amplified by adding on further floors. Until the uneveness of the floors results in some "being john malkovish" half floor.

Which makes plain the problem.

It turns out that tests and types are solving for the same thing in complex software systems. They are trying to flush out interfaces that naturally want to be ambigous.
