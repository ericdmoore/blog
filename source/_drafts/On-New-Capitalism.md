Clean up an old car, you have a clean old car. Albeit a nicer car than before, the new one retains the essance of a old car.

[Elizabeth Warren](^0), [Marc Benioff](^1) and other "Davos would be's" believe that capitalism must die, or at least reincarnate into something else. I have spent some time with many ideas regardingthe this topic, and I find, based on amply available literature, Marc and other well-funded, and well-meaning (hopefully) world leaders have it close but not correct.

A number of books on the topic [Scarcity](^2), [Winner Takes All](^3), [Capital in the 21st Century](^4), [Radical Markets](^5), and plenty more literature all beg the question:

> If we replace capitalism, the economic system that has produced the most sizeable increase in human living standards, with "new capitalism", what assurances will we have that we don't kill its essence in an attempt to innoculates its negatives. Is capitalism the structral intrinsic problem or is it the kind of capitalism we as American carry out in our daily lives that is problematic.

 But first, let's establish some ground rules:

# First, A Small Accord

Before we as readers (yes, decent writers (of which I make attempts to be) play both reader and writer) tread into the waters of an opinion piece written on the internet (a dangerous place indeed). Let's first agree to rules of engagement:

1. I count my self among the reasonably informed and voting citizenry. Certainly not up on all current events (as my day job does not prioritize my time there) and I am well versed in today's buzz-word of "STEM thinking" as a formally trained electrical engineer.
2. I, as non-omniscient being, make mistakes. In fact a lot of them, one may have even occurred in the subsequent thoughts. And should you make an appeal that there is some logical flaw in the composition of ideas. I will amend/edit/cut/etc concepts required to fix it if you follow #3.
3. I am a human, and as such am an emotional being. I respond to possibly firm but "make a more perfect union" discussions. I will not humor change requests that are foul, incendiary, or other-wise prove them selves to be demeaning to me or other readers. If you read this as of course, "8 year kid rules of be nice" should apply to every aspect of adult life: please read on. If you read this as "This guy...." is totally not open for criticism: I encourage you to not waste a second more of your time and head back to your sub-reddit channel or where ever you came from.

# New Coke: New Capitalism ?

The Headline for consideration:

> Capitalism, especially within the last 4 decades, became ill under the severe influence of "shorttermism"

Any notion of replacing capitalism should incorporate the well documented human-nature for selfishness and shortermism, ideally harnessing them productively, in a manner more effective than "plain-old-capitalism" freshly vaccinated against short-termism.

And let me say that, I like many other people who "are paying attention to things" have noticed that: YES, there is a rising inequality gap that seems, at least in part, exacerbated by structural issues within capitalism. YES there is climate warming that is in some form caused by green house gases that are rife with issues of personalize profits and communalized costs in capitalism. YES there are too many examples of lingering and pernicious systemic racism in America - even still - as we round the corner on 2020 which at its core stem from labor fears brought about by capitalism. YES, politics is infiltrating every corner of American daily life like an uncontainable mold that makes everything smell similarly unpleasant largely brought about by the economics of the free press in an ever widening digital landscape. YES there are people(bots?) on the internet that say horrific things and that cause real psychological damage to real people: see incentives for digital news media. YES, there are a depression worthy number of mass shootings in this country due to capitalist economics for gun-owners. YES, police save people from terrible situations overwhelming most of the time, but also... YES there are a depression worthy number of police brutality cases in this country (not due to capitalism, but also not worth omitting)

I could go on... really I could.

But alas, let's get to the NOs. NO. I don't find that we have a culture (culture is a locale-centric-construct) as well versed in governmental theory as the founders of the country. I believe Abigail Adams, and countless other founding figures be much more likely schooled in governmental theory than myself. NO. the planet has never seen another economic system that creates more surplus for more people. This is even true for the beloved socialist Scandinavian countries.

I believe we have a system that has worked so well its has been copied whole-sale the world over. I believe if you have watched the play Hamilton ( or listened to the soundtrack as endlessly as I have) you are aware that the Hamiltonian Capitalism we started with was AMAZINGLY Successful. In fact, it was an 8th wonder of the world for a time.

So what about "new capitalism". I find the movei Jerry Maguire adept at explaining that "Tonight Jerry" is about to have some fun at the cost of "Morning Jerry"

"Morning Jerry" is always left to pick up the pieces from the shorterm-ism from "Tonight Jerry". So often we can compartmentalize things into unhealthy mental accounting. Where do a little bit good and then get wildly selfish. But for Jerry if "Tonight Jerry" could project forward to 11:45 and see how badly "Lunch-time Jerry" is doing perhaps we would tone it down. Not having a long enough vantage point for decision making was "Tonight Jerry"'s hubris.

Time horizon considerations are cultural thing. If you and your boss have differing view points on how far into the future must we consider when building things now... you will have many disagreements about methods and quality standards. The point here is that external forces can shape your time-horizon. Consider earnings calls from various public companies in America and Japan.

Without going into the details, it suffices to say that Japanese companies are often "longterm goal oriented", and American companies are often "short-term results" oriented.

One is not better than the other; and even sticking with an Eastern theme, you might argue they are Yin and Yang complements.

Short-term Objectivity is an honesty about what is happening now, and then long term vision for how things must get better, and also better for who.

I feel like without the acknowledgment that human nature tends to favor tangible and concrete over conceptual and abstract (see mortality statistics for driving). The right to free speech was no doubt granted on the heels of tangible dissent that cost people's lives. It's all too easy to now take that for granted these days - It's too easy to think: "who needs free speech?" since sometimes I accidentally and unintentionally say mean things to unknown groups of people.

Back to the headline for a moment: we could summarize it to read pick "new capitalism" if it changes selfishness and shortermisms into a public benefit more than plain-old-capitalism vaccinated for shortermism. A very reasonable question is what is a "shortermism vaccinations" what would it do? How could it work? What types of analogs can we draw on to surmize its efficacy? These are all great quetions and worthy of more words that belong in their own home. So consider that the topic of my next inquiry.

So in conclusion, capitalism need not be put in the blocks with tomatoes thrown at it. But the Marc Benioff's of the world will likely prescribe their own system as Hamilton once did for plain-old-capitalism. The New Capitalism may have different principles than the present one, and conversely different problems than the present one. but I for one will be asking my self how does it address short-termism. Because with out at least the acknowledgement that it is a silent killer of democratic dreams, I think new capitalism will taste a lot like classic capitalism.

It seems we have taken up moral quips with a morally neutral system and we have ultimately found a large scale-mankind mirror. I fall on the side that capitalism is a tool that can be used for good and for ill, but existing clearly outside the purview of morality.

Similarly when Darwin and Clausewitz discuss famine, flood, earthquakes, lunar eclipses, drought, and harvest they are not described through a judgment of good or bad, or moral or immoral - but merely as physical phenomenon. I find capitalism to fall in the same camp.

But before we adopt Social Darwinism, let us remind ourselves what the accomplished author Aldous Huxley said about "survival of the fittest". He said that we should not conflate "fit" with _good, smart, moral_, or even _strong_. But rather more like **survival of the most beguiling**.

**Afterwards**

At the risk of nonchalently adding in a substatial extra claim, I also think that a diverging sense of morality compounds all the issues at hand since they errode at the common unequivocally good parts that can be started with no flapping of lips. I may even go on to argue that shortermism is a mere symptom of the actual root cause of the state of our "moral errosion".. but that requires more time and thinking.
