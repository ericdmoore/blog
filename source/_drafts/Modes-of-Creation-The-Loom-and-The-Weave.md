Here is the history of the tech industry over the last 30 years:

1. `IBM, Oracle, & LotusNotes` - Centralized Business Solutions Era
2. `WINTEL` - The Word Processor Era
3. `LAMP` - The Search & Social Era
4. `Mobile` - SmartPhone Wars iOS vs Android & Others
5. `The AI OS` - has not happened yet

The premise here is that, as mankind our "mode of creation" or said differently, our tools of building things is inextricably intertwined with what we tend to create.

Often the problems we aim to solve are so great that we create incredible tooling to solve the problem better, faster, cheaper. It is the brilliance of solving this pre-problem that accelates our efforts over the momumental hurdle.

Often this solution-zero approach leaves behind some great tooling, the voiceless, inanimate, unsung hero of an era. The creators that are able to rewrite the rules by using the new tooling are heralded as the heros. Reasonably so. But after the original set of creators are old, gray, fat, happy statespeople.

Through this lens, we can view the brief history of personal computing. Note: I did not say personal computers, as certainly we can acknowledge the personal computer is far less important in the age of the tablet and mobile era.

### Business Solutions Era
When computers we scarce the mode of creation was independent. It had to be computers were scarce. Any idea that required collaboration died on the vine due to the underlying economics of getting an increasing number of people on computers.


### Wintel Era
Microsoft Windows creates a unfied layer on top of standard off the shelf parts (Intel's x86 chip). 


### LAMP Era
Then Tim Breners Lee, the real creator of the internet (Sorry Al), sparks the idea that what if we could unifiy information across all computers. Which basically supercharges the idea of remote connecting to another computer, an idea that came into light in the 70s at Xerox Park. But that is history. 

For those who have never heard of the LAMP stack, I don't mean a light on an end table.I mean the tools of the trade to make a great website (of that time) 

- **L**inux: a completely free operating system. With similar principles as Unix which was born at ATT's Bell Labs in the 70s.
- **A**pache, the orginal killer app (a web server) for open source.
- **M**ySQL, the most common open source database program
- **P**earl/Python - two common open source programming languages.

Each of those words represent a component needed to make a great website of 
that time.

So what started as geeks who knew how to sit on the command line issuing commands to a computer (speaking to the computer) evolved into a browser. So that in a very scientific way, you could browse, or explore for interesting things using a GUI. Enter the browser wars for users, and the proliferation of  the LAMP stack for creators.

#### Web 2.0

Eventually browsers become a mode of creation them selves with enough stuff to create interactivity into the browser.

### Mobile Era

The mobile era is abour Metcalffe's Law. It states the value of a network increases with each new person added to the network; and eventhough each new person represents 1 new person, they represent a new available connection for each person already there. The number of connections grows by adding the whole network back into itself every time a new person joins.

Consider the fax machine example. A fax machine: an old machine that used to scan paper and send it to a printer at someone elses home

| fax machines |               connections |
|--------------+---------------------------|
| 1            |      0 = creates no value |
| 2            |          1 = little value |  
| 5            |            10  | 
| 12           |            66 = growing faster on each new connection | 

Metcalfe law was the first answer to Moore's law. 


### AI OS

Enter the AI Operating System.

The next revolution of creation will be people augmented with AI. Where AI agents are supportive editors, they are suggesting new ideas, they are monitoring the stats of our website, and trying to posit suggestions for conjoint adaptions, for conjoin creations.

### Quesitons

1. Moores law is ending, is Metcalfe's law ending?
