When shopping for clothes many people understand "fit" is often the most important factor. More important than fabric, texture, color, pattern, and countless other things that make up the style of a piece - something either fits or it doesn't. Sometimes we say "its close" because the rest of it is really nice. Hugging in all the wrong places is a sure way to get the boot.

Its incredible how we forget this truism when looking at technology. Maybe because we can't "feel it" like a shirt. I have this same type of relationship with Wordpress. Before you write me off as a Wordpress hater, let's put all the cards on the table. I love Wordpress. I love it's philosophy, I love that it worked on a "famous five minute install". I think it embodies much of the worderful pricinples of a free an open web. 

Having said that Wordpress is like an old favorite shirt from your senior year of high school. No one told you that you have outgrown that shirt. They just look at you funny. No one told you that, though it is a great shirt in its own right, you are stretching it beyond its intended goal. 

Again, Wordpress is great, however WordPress's own ubiquity has been its greatest detrement. I have seen people do strange things with WordPress. Again, I love WordPress - I just feel bad for people who never considered that there are other smaller outfits that cater to spepcifc needs.

But again, full disclosure, I am starting a new project that aims to be an eject button for people once they realize they have outgrown wordpress.S

Wordpress is fantastic.

But when you get your first:

- Email from your Host saying your site is doing bad things
	- AKA: your server caught the flu or some worse Russian Virus
- Need Significant User Flow & Themes Customization
- User Saying: "I tried your site - but it did not load on my phone"
- Needed a Plugin, but could not (wordpress.com)
- Your Developer Needed you to 
- E-Commerce or User Transactions Embeded Into Your Site
