On a Wednesday from 9am till 1pm, I worked rescue requests on Twitter like someone's life depended on it. I have never been more satisfied with a 4 hour break from "work".

It started by seeing a retweet for phone numbers to call if i lived in Houston. A little more digging and you would see numbers for Coporus, Houston, Beaumont, Port Arthur (PAT) and for Port Aransas (PortA)

Then it happened. Someone casually mentioning that people are shooting out flare tweets for help.
I wanted to see if that was true, but was qucikly met by the situation of how to find these tweets.

Search for : need help within:30mi of Port Arthur - (the Uncategorized Stream)

8 min later of observing and I picked up that some twitter saints were tagging converations with #HarveySOS. Interesting. You also find a stream of people in boats who have no plan but want to help. often in this uncategorized stream the tweets sit side by side.

Search for : #HarveySOS or #HarveyRescue (the Categorized Stream) and see an onslaught of people posting addressess, phone numbers, and similar in genuine pleas for help. You would also see people working those tweets - moving that data to a couple of websites.

And you find forwarded tweets. Someone like me went through and figured out that someone had not figured out to group them selves in to a hashtag. So someone does it for them. All on the assumption that seconds matter.

This profile: @HarveyRescue
At that profile you will find a group of self assembled people aimed at organizing the information. 

Incredble. I was moved. I was touched. Really, by the amount of care, humanity, empathy shown by other remote volunteers.

<!-- more --> 

But after I had forwarded this image of phone numbers a few times, I realized that I did not verify anything before mindlessly forwarding. So I called a few numbers. I won't say which because there were only two categories. (1) Busy Signal (2) Endless Phone Tree and No One Answered.

I was 95% sure that other people had called those numbers too with the same response. This is when it had hit me - FEMA, USCG Heartland, etc. all likely get a ton of the same questions. 

1. Can you help me? 
2. What do I tell my friend who is stuck on her roof?
3. Other non-emergency but still high importance calls
4. Non important calls

I realized that with little to know training, I would be able to likely figure out with high confidence the difference of each phone call. More important, in the time of great stress I would be a human voice.

But alas I am not a trained psychologist, I am not a trained emergecy responder, it has even been a long time sine I last passed a Red Cross CPR test. We can say that we can only take people who fit a narrow window. OR we can give people a human first impression - instead of a pesstering phone tree loop or busyÂ signal.
