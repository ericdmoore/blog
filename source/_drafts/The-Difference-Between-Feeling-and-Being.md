Safety and Success share more than just the starting letter. 

A great deal of confusion surrounds the differences between "how to be safe" vs "how to feel safe".  An incredible distinction to get right for product people.
The same distinction is also true of success - there is an ocean separating "Feeling Successful" and "Being Successful". So often people "don't feel successful", but it is certainly peculiar the words we use to describe those are state-of-being-verbs vs achievement verbs.

In reality we are very good at feeling things (other than achievement of success)

Ven Diagram...
Perhaps there is no intersection...

Security Blanket = Feeling safe
Enveloped in a Big Hug = Feeling safe
Locking Your Doors = Feeling safe
TSA at the Airport = Feeling safe

Boiling Your Filtered Water Before you drink it = Being Safe
Fighting terrorists on an airplane = Being Safe

Seat Belts = middle ground - risk reducer

OR what about success?

being successful vs feeling successful?
