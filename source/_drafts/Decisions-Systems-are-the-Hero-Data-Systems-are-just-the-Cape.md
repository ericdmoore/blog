Consider a standard clich√© example:

An app that helps optimize your timing of social media posts for maximizing reach and/or effectiveness.

**Version 1**: probably has 2 sections. (A) Main App to create social media posts B) Analytics Tab. The graphs might show click counts per hour for links recetly posted. The user is supposed to learn and decide when to schedule the next post. 

**Version 2**: Likely starts to integrate the two tabs. After all looking at charts by them selves is only so interesting for mere mortals. V2 starts to provide real time click estimate s for each post would be shown as you type with an estimate of when to post.

**Version 3**: Would have relegated the analytics part to the back seat. You build a backlog of posts to be scheduled - and the brains eat through that queue and notify the user if it encounters issues.
