I am a creationist. I believe that the content I create is exclusively owned by me.

# Creation
The act of creation is one of the purest forms of being human. Capable of making art, we create buildings that ascend to the heavens, we create paintings that capture lillies on a pond. In less of a classical sense, plenty of artists pour their heart and soul into making electroncis or apps that make people's lives better everyday too.

What we create is important. Creation is the highest form of critique, creation is the best means of learning. What we create is an outgrowth of who we are. When are are proud of what we create, often we share it with friends and the world.

	To create is to be human. To share is to particpate with mankind.
	The World needs players not spectators.
	Make something. Share it. Smile. Repeat.

If what we create (online) is so important - whether that is a blog post, an art gallery, a web app, etc. Why is it that we as a population of proud netizens <sup>[âŠ™](#foot1)</sup> are so quick to sign over our rights to the content we make - offering up joint custody or worse with our platform.

# The Rub
Consider these terms from:

[Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/terms-of-service):
- Actually not that egregious

[Blogger](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/):
- Actually not that egregious 

[Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/terms-of-service/):
- Pretty reasonable

# Conclusion
Davinci may have borrowed the brushes, easel, and canvas, but he did not leave his Mona Lisa jointly owned in a rented studio; but in today's terms of use that is often what we signing up for when we mindlessly click "Accept" at the bottom of a TOS agreement.

If I am going to pour my heart and soul into a project, I want to know from the start - that I solely own the rights to my project - and with out question.
