Imagine a world where the things you read are graded for

- bias
- opinion
- belief
- factually
- truthful

We can debate about how to do that. What I don't think is up for debate is that this is a very needed aspect of digital life in 2018.

Imagine a publihsing platform that would allow you to hire a fact checker for each piece you were publishing. What if you could hire a digital artist for an infographic that someone put together for you.

Imagine how that same publishing platform allows you to own every aspect about your online publication. If you wanted to eject and host it personally, you could do that. If you wanted to download your source code you could do that. (Afterall, it IS YOU source code)
