What is what is the difference between Security vs Survelience?

What if "privacy" is what we used to call liberty.
liberty freedom from permission.
Joseph Gables 
	Privacy is a thing to protect


Proposition "All bats are mammals"
Restated as the conditional "If something is a bat, then it is a mammal"
Contrapositive condition: "If something is not a mammal, then it is not a bat."
Contrapositive statement: " non-mammals are non-bats"


Do you believe that we are a people of laws?
Is there anyone above the laws?
What is something that separates our country from any other?

The fact that we put our laws above everything else.


The Bulleted Bill of Rights 
---------------
###  Redrafted in Contrapositive Form:


1. Freedom of religion is wasted if you believe nothing.
1. Freedom of speech is stupid if you believe you have nothing to say.
1. Freedom of an open, independent press is muted with the belief that nothing is worth reading.
1. Freedom to assemble is worthless if you believe no one will encourage you.
1. Freedom to petition is made lame if you believe the goverment is not needing reform.
1. The Right to have a militia is not needed if nothing is worth fighting for.
1. The Right to have guns is not requried if nothing is worth shooting.
1. The Right to privacy in your own house (not housing soldiers) is unecessary if we are incapable of using soldiers.
1. The Right to unlawful "pat down" & "confiscation" (search and seizure) is superfluous if you believe nothing is private.
1. The "right to keep quiet" in order to stay out of jail is overkill if jail is better than your current living.
1. The right to a speedy trial is voiceless if court hearings are the only thing worth living for.
1. The States Rights are limp if the federal governemt acts solely in states interest.
1. The right to hold other unlisted rights is extraneous if no other rights are worth having.

Haggard Idea: Finding a balance between liberty and secuirty.

But what if we are not actual seeing a fight there. What if this is a false dichotomy?
