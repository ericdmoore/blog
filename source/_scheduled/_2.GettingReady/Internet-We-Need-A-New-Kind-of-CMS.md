title: Internet, We Need a New Kind of CMS
toc: true
---

Right now the state of the CMS is that wordpress owns the market. Wordpress is AMAZING. The ethos of wordpress is inspring. They are one of the last bastions fighting for everyone to own their corner of the web. Wordpress might be the most popular piece of software ever created.


# Next Gen CMS Manifesto:

## People Friendly
Real people have to be able to use the system. If my mom can not figure out the system, then it still favors developers too much.

## Developer Friendly
Developers need APIs. Developers need Documentation. Developers need to be able to extend, via plugins, via external systems to really make a system their own. 

## Extereme Low Cost
Because the lower the cost - the more people speak out

## Highly Extentable
Plugins for everyone. Plugins that do all kinds of new and different things. 100s of plugins would never work in current systems.

## High Ownership
Squarespace is great, but you will always be subject to their terms of service - as they host your content for you.

## High Visibilty
Feed the machine, but do so willingly and knowingly. Live on your own terms when you don't care to fill someone else's database.

## High Security
Russia "likes to play" on the internet. China "likes to play" on the internet. This is the world we live in. It shows not sign of changing anytime soon. Passwords are the weak link. If there is a password, the system will get hacked. 2-Factor Authenication is great for much of the developer audience. It still has not become commonplace for the audience that includes my wife (she is a crazy intelligent woman) who prefers convenience over the "off-chance of a security issue".

## High Performance
If at all possible, a new CMS would put guide rails on developers so that the norm is a high performance theme, plugin, database, etc. In a model where you pay when something is running. Having it finish sooner reaps real dollars and cents rewards. Think performance that the reader or author can feel in their experience or pocketbook.

## High Scalability
Last and certainly not least, the biggest problem with the existing solutions is the terrible expected trade off between visibility and scalability. This is undoubtedely because handling #web-scale stuff is hard. Whether that is web-scale traffic, or #web-scale data. Queue up the Mongo Web Scale video. Having worked on the internet long-enough you quickly realize that very few people have web-scale problems on their site. unless your name is [Jeff Bezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos) or [Sundar Pichai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai)

# Analysis

Here is some cool analysis that I have done on each of the existing players on how they stack up.

## Comparision Graphic

Here is a radar graphic.

Here are some thoughts and synthesis on what is there - what I would pick - but how they still come short.

## Comparison Grid

|    | B  | C  | D  | E  |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  |
| 2  | 2  | 2  | 2  | 2  |
| 3  | 3  | 3  | 3  | 3  | 


# Conclusion

## Last Thoughts
I used to use this very bare-bones service called [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/) and it always got me thinking that the total number of ideas expressed on the internet is limited by how costly it is to publish those thoughts.

## What Now ??

I have been thinking about this for a while, and there is nothing that satisfies my wish list.
- Very Low Cost
- People First
- Higly Extendable
- High Visibility
- and Modern Assumptions 
	- about Security, Plugins, Developers, etc
