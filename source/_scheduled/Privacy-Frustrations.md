I started this blog a while ago as a prototype for The Mirage Project. The Mirage Project is a new CMS aimed at making it hard to make a slow website - while still being able to customize YOUR website as you see fit.

Comments are a 'table-stakes' feature for a blog. Disqus feels like the no brainer to solve for easy add on comments. But NOW MY site aggrevates my Ad Block Plugins.

I like to use:

- EFF Privacy Badger
- Ad Block Plus
- Ad Block Plus Helper

Between those 3, rest assured I see all the Ad Block Blcokers (ehh emm Forbes.com)

But it is a bit frustrating to create a blog that is as begnign as I know how. But lo, the off the shelf easy buttons are the culprit. I should have known.
