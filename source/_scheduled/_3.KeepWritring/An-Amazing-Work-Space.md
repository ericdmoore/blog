Goals:
- Neighborhood Pods
- Cross functional Collaboration
- Idea Generating

- Marker Boards

  - Sometimes cords are thw way to go
  - AppleTVs are great when they work


Don't Forget:
- Private Converations about your latest doctor appointment may feel unconfortable to broadcast verbally across the floor.
- Having 2 cell phone rooms, somewhere on the floor (with paper thin walls) does not cut it
