/MirageProject#Problem

	I lose people on my website because it is slow
	  When I lose people on my website -
	    they don't buy stuff
	    they don't share my website since they are dealing with it
	    they don't come back to it ever
	  I need to own my content because - 
	    I care about an open web
	    I don't like other options
	    I don't know - but if you can help let's talk

  	- Always Leave Abussive Relationships
  		- Hire a Site Counselor (aka: Developer) to help w/ communication issues
  		- Find Your Factory Soulmate : Tumblr/Medium/Squarespace
  		- Hit the Easy Button and Live Happily Ever After

  	- I don't want to wp-manage please
  		- webflow/dato/contentful
  		- static site - YAY - marketing has to write in md
  		- best use of IT's time?
  		- use hubspot? and hire a front-end/stylist

  	- A friend of mine said this is better than WP (drops the mic - and rev the growth engine)
  	- I need our developers working on higher value stuff than designing websites
  	- I need a mobile-friendly micro-site for our next campaign in 30 min
